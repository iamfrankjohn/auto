**iamfrankjohn's | Auto Clicker & Macro**

iamfrankjohn's | Auto Clicker & Macro is a powerful, yet easy-to-use, application that records your keyboard and mouse actions to automate repetitive tasks. This guide will help you get started with the app's core features.

Features
Keyboard & Mouse Recording: Capture all your key presses, mouse clicks, and mouse movements.

Hotkeys: Control recording and playback from any application using global hotkeys.

Loop Playback: Repeat your macro automatically for a set number of times or indefinitely.

Save & Load Macros: Save your recorded actions to a file for later use.

**How to Use**
1. The Interface
The main window of AutoMacro has a simple set of controls:

Record Button (F6): Click this to start recording your actions. The button's icon will change to show it's active.

Play Button (F7): Click this to start playing back your recorded macro.

Stop Button (F8): Click this to immediately stop an active recording or playback.

File Icon: Click this to open a previously saved macro file.

Loop Textbox: Enter the number of seconds to wait between macro loops.

2. Hotkeys
You can control the application using these global hotkeys, which work even when the AutoMacro window is minimized:

F6: Starts or stops a recording.

F7: Starts playback of the last recorded or loaded macro.

F8: Stops any active playback or recording.

3. Recording a Macro
Click the Record button or press F6 to begin. The app's status bar will indicate that recording has started.

Perform the actions you want to record (e.g., typing, clicking, dragging the mouse, etc.).

When you are finished, click the Stop button or press F6 again to end the recording. The app will automatically prompt you to save the macro.

4. Playing Back a Macro
Make sure you have a macro recorded or loaded from a file.

Click the Play button or press F7 to start playback.

The app will now repeat the exact sequence of events you recorded.

To stop the playback at any time, click the Stop button or press F8.

5. Saving and Loading Macros
To Save: After you stop recording, a "Save As" dialog will appear automatically. Choose a location and name your macro file. You can also save a macro by simply closing the recording.

To Load: Click the File icon and select a previously saved .mcr file. The macro will be loaded and ready for playback. The filename will be displayed on the app's interface.

**Troubleshooting**
My macro isn't working in my game!
Some applications, especially games with anti-cheat software, can block or ignore automated input. While AutoMacro uses advanced methods to simulate human-like input, there is no guarantee it will work in every application.

Drag-and-drop isn't working.
This feature requires recording continuous mouse movements. The application is designed to capture these, but ensure you move the mouse slowly and deliberately during recording to get a more accurate playback.

Why is my keyboard macro not working?
Your program only simulates the KeyDown and KeyUp events. If a program requires a long key press, you need to hold the key for a moment while recording so the KeyDown and KeyUp events have a larger gap in between them.

The hotkeys don't work.
Ensure the AutoMacro application is running. The hotkeys won't work if the app is closed. If the app is running but the hotkeys aren't working, try running the application with administrator privileges.
